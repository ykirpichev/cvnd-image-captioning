    "\n",
    "Begin by setting `batch_size`, `vocab_threshold`, `vocab_from_file`, `embed_size`, `hidden_size`, `num_epochs`, and `save_every`:\n",
    "- `batch_size` - the batch size of each training batch.  It is the number of image-caption pairs used to amend the model weights in each training step.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) demonstrates reasonable performance with a batch size of `64`, but you might get be able to get good results faster by training with larger batches (e.g., batch size `128`).\n",
    "- `vocab_threshold` - the minimum word count threshold.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) uses a minimum word count threshold of `5`.  You're welcome to explore here, but you probably shouldn't deviate too much from this suggested threshold.  Remember that a larger threshold will result in a smaller vocabulary, and a smaller threshold will include rarer words and result in a larger vocabulary.\n",
    "- `vocab_from_file` - \n",
    "- `embed_size` - the dimensionality of the image and word embeddings.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) used an embedding size of `512`, but you should still be able to get good results by setting the size of the embedding to a smaller value (e.g., `256`).\n",
    "- `hidden_size` - the number of features in the hidden state of the RNN decoder.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1411.4555.pdf) used a hidden size of `512`, which should form a useful starting point.  However, again, you are encouraged to experiment here!\n",
    "- `num_epochs` - the number of epochs to train the model.  We recommend that you set `num_epochs=5`, but feel free to increase or decrease this number as you wish.  [This paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf) trained a captioning model on a single state-of-the-art GPU for 3 days, but you'll soon see that you can get reasonable results in a matter of a few hours!  (_But of course, if you want your model to compete with current research, you will have to train for much longer._)\n",
    "- `save_every` - determines how often to save the model weights.  We recommend that you set `save_every=1`, to save the model weights after each epoch.\n",

    "### (Optional) TODO #2\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we have provided a recommended image transform `transform_train` for pre-processing the training images, but you are welcome (and encouraged!) to modify it as you wish.  When modifying this transform, keep in mind that:\n",
    "- the images in the dataset have varying heights and widths, and \n",
    "- if using a pre-trained model, you must perform the corresponding appropriate normalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### TODO #3\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you will specify a Python list containing the learnable parameters of the model.  For instance, if you decide to make all weights in the decoder trainable, but only want to train the weights in the embedding layer of the encoder, then you should `params` to something like:\n",
